This is a bug fix release. We fixed requiring password parameter for editing
basic users. Also we made consistent saving Exclude resource in the same JSON
form as it was get from the API.

Changes:
 - Fix providing password parameter to basic user edit endpoint
 - Fix saving Exclude resource in the same form as it comes from API
