This is a bug fix release. We fixed bugs reported by Community. Apart from that
we prepared changes to support openSUSE / SLES binary packages. At the end
we did improvements in the deployment function and we updated the SELinux policy
module.

**Changes**

 * Add example sudo setting for SLES/openSUSE
 * Disable PHP-CS-Fixer rule for blank lines
