This is new function and bug fix release. We have set the table headers as fixed. This means
that from now when scrolling through long tables, the table headers are visible all the time.
This helps to orient in the table columns regardless of the web browser scroll position.
Additionally, we added run job button to enable starting jobs on job list table.

On the bug fixes side, we fixed several important bugs. Some fixes improve overall application
performance. Of particular note is the fix for page timeout in some cases.

We have also added changes reported by the Community. Thank you for your activity and these
reports. Every comment or remark counts.
