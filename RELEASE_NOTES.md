This is a minor bug fix release. We fixed problems that were detected by static
code analysis tools. Also there has been improved logging/debugging to file. We
changed a bit the logs format to make them more readable. At the end we
automated code analysing and releasing process. We hope it will help in providing
new releases more frequent.

Changes:
 - Use new logging interface
 - Update LICENSE file
 - Update dependencies in composer.json
 - Fix problems found in static code analysis
